# Research Reports Collection

This repository serves as a centralized archive for research reports generated from various data science and computational social science projects. Each report documents the methodology, results, and insights from individual research efforts, providing a resource for future reference, collaboration, and reproducibility.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Consolidate project reports for easy access and sharing.
- Provide context and background for each research effort.
- Enable reproducibility by outlining methods and results.
- Serve as a starting point for new research or extensions of existing work.

## Contents

Currently, the repository includes:

- **GerryChain Report** ([gerrychain-report.pdf](/Users/happiness/src/misc/research-reports/gerrychain-report.pdf)):  
  Documents the use of the GerryChain library for computational redistricting and analysis of political districting plans. The report covers algorithmic approaches, data sources, and findings related to fairness and representation in districting.

- **Text Classifier Report** ([text-classifier-report.pdf](/Users/happiness/src/misc/research-reports/text-classifier-report.pdf)):  
  Details the development and evaluation of a machine learning text classifier. The report includes model selection, feature engineering, performance metrics, and applications in automated document categorization.

## Potential File Structure

To support future growth and organization, we might implement the following structure: 

```
research-reports/
├── gerrychain-report.pdf
├── text-classifier-report.pdf
├── README.md
├── data/
│   └── [project-specific datasets]
├── code/
│   └── [analysis scripts, notebooks]
├── references/
│   └── [bibliography, related papers]
└── templates/
    └── [report templates, guidelines]
```

- **data/**: Raw and processed datasets used in each project.
- **code/**: Source code, scripts, and notebooks for analysis and modeling.
- **references/**: Bibliography and related literature.
- **templates/**: Standardized templates for future reports.
